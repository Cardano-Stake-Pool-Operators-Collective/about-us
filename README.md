# What is the CSTOC 
About Us

The CSTOC has been founded in August 2020 to provide a support and certification roadmap for Cardano Stake Pool Operators and create a healthy stake pool infrastructure for the benefits of all.

# What are we trying to achieve

With this collective we are aiming to achieve to following

- Transparency on "Who" the stake pool operators (SPOs) are
- Analyses of the Infrastructure of each member
- Analyses of the security of each member
- Providing support and recommendations to the SPOs
- Offer mediating services between multi-owner SPOs and customers
- Certification of the stake pools based on their analyses (A+ --- E)

Our aim is to create a strong network of SPOs with a best practise infrastrucutr.  We are looking to do this with support of partners such as the STOs, various pool ranking operators and organizations such as IOHK. 

# What are the benefits to our members

Being part of the CSTOC will provide the members a number of benefits such as:

- Access to a strong topology network with vetted and quality nodes (24/7 uptimes)
- Verifable certifications to highlight the SPOs skills and ability
- Support channels for various stake pool setup's and operations
- Marketable for your stakers to attract a larger stake
- Access to best practise guides
- Access to community made tools
